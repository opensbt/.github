## Welcome to the OpenSBT group 👋

🙋‍♀️ OpenSBT is a modular framework for the virtual validation of complex systems using heuristic testing techniques. 
Originally, it has been develeped to provide a generic environment for validating automated driving systems. 
Recently, it started to support researchers in testing learning-enabled components across various domains.

🌈 OpenSBT is open-source and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. We encourage contributions of all kinds. 
Whether you have feature requests or encounter issues, feel free to create tickets or open discussions.

👩‍💻 Documentation for the core OpenSBT framework can be found [here](https://opensbt.github.io/opensbt-core/).


## Repositories
Implemented extensions and main repositories of OpenSBT include:

- [OpenSBT-Core](https://github.com/opensbt/opensbt-core): Contains the OpenSBT framework and usage tutorials.
- [CARLA Runner](https://github.com/opensbt/carla-runner): Contains a simulation adapter to integrate the CARLA Simulator to simulate CARLA Agents and FMI-based SUTs with OpenSBT.
- [Prescan Runner](https://github.com/opensbt/prescan_runner): Contains a simulation adapter to integrate an Simulink-based SUT with OpenSBT to simulate it in the Prescan Simulator.
